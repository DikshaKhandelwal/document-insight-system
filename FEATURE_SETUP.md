### **2. Start Your Frontend** 
```bash
cd d:\document-insight-system
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
✅ Your frontend should start on `http://localhost:3000`

### **3. Test the Feature**
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/reader`

2. Check frontend console for errors
3. The fallback demo content should still display

### **If Gemini AI isn't available:**
- The feature will use fallback personalities
- Still demonstrates the concept perfectly for judges

### **If styling looks off:**
- Restart the development server
- Check that all components imported correctly

## 🎯 **DEMO CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS**

### **What Makes This Special:**
1. **Unique Concept** - No other team will have AI personality debates
2. **Practical Use** - Actually useful for research analysis

5. **Scalable Design** - Clear path to advanced features

### **Backup Demo Points:**
- Even if AI generation fails, fallback content shows the concept
- The UI design alone demonstrates thoughtful UX
- Integration with existing document system shows technical competence
- Persona concept is innovative regardless of implementation
